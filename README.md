# Uncash app

the app is a money transfer services for transfering money between smart phones. 



### how the service works 
first you should create an account ,put your phone number nd you will be provided with a verification code verify your phone and create the account then sign in 
for sending code i used the twilio service for free messages transfer .



##### recharge : 

if you want to recharge your account with money you you should do the following :
- open the "branches" section in the app to see the nearest branch to recharge 
- go to this branch and give the provider the amount you want to recharge with 
- the provider will transfer you the amount from his account at our service 


##### take money :
- open the "branches" section in the app to see the nearest branch 
- go to this branch and tell  the provider the amount you want to take  
- you should tranfer the amount needed to the provider and he will give you the amount you transferd to him .



##### tranfer :

- you can transfer money to any one by using manual transfer or QR code transfer 
###### manual transfer : you provide the app the receiver username and the amount 
###### QR code transfer : the receiver generates a QR code with his username and amount you scan this code and amount will be sent
